# Slick Messenger - A Slack Clone

Slick is a messaging app built with **Rails** (backend) and **React** (frontend), inspired by Slack. Users can send direct messages to each other, update their profiles, and upload profile pictures. This project demonstrates a full-stack approach with Rails as the backend API and React for the frontend.

## Features
- **User authentication** with email and password using **Devise** and **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Send and receive direct messages** between users.
- **Profile management**: Users can update their profile information and upload a profile picture using Active Storage.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails, **Devise-JWT** (for JSON Web Token authentication), Active Storage (for handling file uploads).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication**: Devise-JWT for token-based authentication.
- **Deployment**: Render (backend) and Netlify (frontend) for hosting.
